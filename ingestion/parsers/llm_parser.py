IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Preserve the EXACT original wording from the job description
2. Each item should be a complete, self-contained statement
3. Do not paraphrase or summarize - use the exact text from the description
4. Requirements are mandatory qualifications (often marked with "required", "must have", "minimum", etc.)
5. Nice-to-have are optional/preferred qualifications (often marked with "nice to have", "preferred", "bonus", "plus", etc.)
6. Responsibilities are job duties and tasks (often marked with "responsibilities", "duties", "will be responsible for", "you will", etc.)
7. If a bullet point contains multiple items, keep them together as one item
8. Remove only the bullet symbols (â€¢, -, *, etc.) but keep everything else
9. Ignore benefits, perks, and compensation information

Job Description:
{description}

Return a JSON object with three arrays:
{{
    "requirements": ["exact requirement text 1", "exact requirement text 2", ...],
    "nice_to_have": ["exact nice-to-have text 1", "exact nice-to-have text 2", ...],
